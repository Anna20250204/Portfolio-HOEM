                This is an event calendar for April, and I chose a marathon theme to reflect the challenges university students face during this month. April marks the final stretch before summer break, filled with exams and deadlines, making it feel like a race to the finish line. With this theme, I aim to motivate and encourage students to push through their academic marathon and reach the finish strong.

        <h2>Postmodern Typography Poster</h2>
        <div class="txt-box">
            <span>Paper, Photoshop / </span>
            <span>W 10inch x H 38inch</span>
            <p>
                This project is about creating a poster for a fictional lecture on typography with three invited speakers. My subject was Postmodern Typography, and three famous female artists, Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holzer, and Paula Shea, were invited. The poster information was written using the Futura typeface, which Barbra Kruger and Jenny Holzer mainly use. While making this poster, the essential point for me was to create a poster that fits the theme of Modern typography.
