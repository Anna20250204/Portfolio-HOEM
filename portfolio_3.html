                The distinction between the real world and the world inside a computer is disappearing. As digitalization accelerates, I have replaced many things with digital ones and avoid paper prints and carry personal laptops for the sake of the environment. As a graphic designer, I know this work goes beyond simply visually digitizing plants. It contains what digital technology means to us in this era and the process of reinterpreting and recreating nature.

                <strong>Process</strong>
                <p>I chose 'flowers' as one of the essences of nature and experimented with various things using a scanner. Based on elements of nature, I created nature in the digital era by utilizing glitch effects and distorted images. I want to convey to the audience that “in an era where everything we do is converted to digital, even nature can be digitized.” I connected the perfection of nature with the imperfection of digital through visual expressions such as pixel breakage and data errors, which can happen in media. This design allows us to create and experience new forms of nature beyond what digital technology records. I also want to ask whether this is our future or my idea.</p>
