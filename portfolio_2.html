                I designed this poster for HOEM's annual Pancake Breakfast event with each floor's Community Assistant. My goal of this poster was to capture the warmth and coziness of a comforting breakfast, creating a welcoming atmosphere that invites residents to enjoy good food and great company.

                This project was re-creating a book cover for a book called “ A Psalm of the Wild Built. Because this is about human and robot lives peacefully in the nature, I chose green as the main color, and used a Mono type font that looks like it came out of an old computer. I tried to express the feeling of an error that occurred in the middle of the harmony between technology and nature that the Earth of the future has.

                <p>
                    The effect that looks like an error was inspired by the cover design of the Korean version of A Psalm of the Wild Built. When I read the book, I thought that the reason why the main character Dex went on a journey was an important element, so I made the grasshopper the main design element. Also, the back cover of the book shows a robot arm, foreshadowing the appearance of the robot Mosscap.
